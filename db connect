#example mysqli object oriented

<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>

#example mysqli procedural

<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

// Create connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
  die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>

#example PDO
// A great benefit of PDO is that it has an exception class to handle any problems that may occur in our database queries.
// If an exception is thrown within the try{ } block, the script stops executing and flows directly to the first catch(){ } block.

<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
