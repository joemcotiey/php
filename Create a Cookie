#A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer.

#Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.

#A cookie is created with the setcookie() function.

<?PHP
$cookie_name = "user"
$cookie_value = "John Doe";
setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day

?>
<HTML>
<body>
<?PHP

if(!isset($_COOKIE[$cookie_name])) {
  echo "Cookie named '" . $cookie_name . "' is not set!";
} else {

  echo "Cookie '" . $cookie_name . "' is set!<be>";

  echo "Value is: " . $_COOKIE[$cookie_name];
}

?>
