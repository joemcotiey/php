//echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
//The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.

//echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print

<?php
echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";

echo "Hello world!<be>";

echo "Iknow PHP!<be>";

echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";

?>
//The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print()

<?PHP
print "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";

print "Hello world!<br>";

print "I'm about to learn PHP!";

?>
