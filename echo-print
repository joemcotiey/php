//echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
//The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.



<?php
echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
echo "Hello world!<br>";
echo "Iknow PHP!<br>";
echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";
?>

//The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print()

<?php
print "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
print "Hello world!<br>";
print "I'm about to learn PHP!";
?>
